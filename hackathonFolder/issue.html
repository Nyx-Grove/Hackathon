            <h1>Why do we need this?</h1>
             <img class="col-md-4" src="https://cdn3.vectorstock.com/i/thumb-large/76/67/unemployed-male-character-with-no-money-left-in-vector-32647667.jpg" height="185px" >
                <p class="col-md-8"> Why do we need a webiste like Bibliophile? Why can't college students just pay full price for these text books? The average person works at an minimum wage job meaning thhey make about 10 dollars an hour.
                    That is a monthly payment of about 1,600 and the average amounts students spend on books for the year is about 1,250. You must be thinking "Great, you can pay for all your textbooks and still have money left over" from one month of payment but wait until you add rent and food into the mix.
                </p><br>

                <p>
                    The average monthly payment for food for a singular person is 350$. The average monthly rent for an one bedroom aparment ranges from 600 to 1,000. Even if we used the lowest rent, adding everything up the average student would only be left with 300 dollars.
                    Do you see the problem now? Another thing is the fact that college studens are humans. They also need money for fun and persobal things. If you could only spend your time and money on school and other necessities life would be very depression. If students were able to access their textbook eaiser then that ar least gets rid of one of thier problems.
